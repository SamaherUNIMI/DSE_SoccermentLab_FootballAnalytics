# Corner Kicks Prediction

## Football Analytics Lab 2024 - UNIMI

This project is part of the Football Analytics Lab 2024 at the University of Milan, delivered by Soccerment, a company specializing in Soccer Data Intelligence.

## Goal

This project aims to predict the total number of corner kicks in a football match using team statistics and historical performance data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes team performance statistics and historical data up to the current match, enabling us to analyze trends and patterns for accurate predictions.

## Challenges

1. **Play Style Variability:** Different play styles and strategies may affect corner kick frequency, requiring adaptive modeling techniques.
2. **Low-Frequency Events:** Defensive games may result in fewer corner kicks, challenging prediction accuracy.
3. **Tactical Variations:** Accounting for tactical differences between teams and across leagues is crucial for accurate predictions.
